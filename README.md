# DnD Buddy
This is a program written in Java.

## What is it?
DnD Buddy is a companion app for DnD, intended to replace the paper sheets regularly used while still remaining true to the DnD style.

## Features
- A player sheet tracks all of your stats while being easy to update
- Session log tracks what occured in each session 
- Dice rollers let you roll any dice up to d100  

## Who is this for?
Hobbyist DnD players who want to reduce the hassle of keeping track of all of the things that occur in a DnD session

## Why make this?
When playing DnD, I always forget to bring my player sheet, so I wanted an easy way of keeping track of everything

## TODO
Implement spells tracker into GUI. Currently only works in console and is not being tracked/displayed in GUI
